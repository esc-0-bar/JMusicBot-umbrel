releaseNotes: >-
  This release fixes some YouTube playback issues and adds the seek feature, alongside some other minor improvements.

  - Switched to a new YouTube source handler internally that should be more stable
  - Added the seek command and the ability to request songs starting at a specific timestamp
  - Starting a song from a specific timestamp is done with the same format that YouTube uses, a &t=123 bit on the end of a URL. Copying a YouTube url that starts from a timestamp should work in JMusicBot now.
  - Seeking within a song can be to an exact timestamp, or forwards/backwards using a + or - and then an amount of time.
  - Allow setting the log level and eval engine in the config (mainly for advanced users)
  - Allow setting the maximum number of YouTube playlist pages that can be loaded (in the config)
  - Reverted the change to make the bot self-deafen because self-deafening doesn't actually reduce bandwidth (see #1554 for details)
  - Minor changes to some log messages
